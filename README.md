# House Price Prediction System

This project is a basic example of a House Price Prediction System using Python and scikit-learn. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a sample dataset containing house features and prices. You can download it (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vedavyasv/usa-housing) and save it as "house_prices.csv" in the project directory.

## Running the Code

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Install the required dependencies if you haven't already (e.g., `pip install pandas scikit-learn`).
3. Download the dataset and save it as "house_prices.csv" in the project directory.
4. Run the Python script: `python house_price_prediction.py`.

## Results

The code will train a random forest regressor on the dataset and provide mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared (R2) score as the evaluation results.
